## Jerry He(ZeBang,He)'s homepage

I receive my BSc Degree from the Computer Department, CSU(Central South University), and MSc Degree from the Computer Engineering Department, City University of Hong Kong. Currently, I am the intern of the ASTRI, and my major direction is Medical Image Analysis.


In the stage of school, my research interests including salient object detection, image layer separation. 

Recently my interests change to Object Detection and Segmentation in medical image analysis based on my work.

Beyond, I have some interests in the interesting Visual Application of the video game and the Virtual character. I have also written an article in BiliBili about the possibility and difficulties when the visual application uses in the game scenes. The address of this article is [Currently None](). And some of the interesting applications will also be introduced in the latter part.

Domain Adaption is not my interest currently. However I find that the algorithms in the real-world perform badly in Game/Virtual Scenes, therefore, I will consider if the domain adaption methods can solve the problem of the domain gap.

### Publication Currently

Lin, Jiaying, Zebang He and Rynson W. H. Lau. “Rich Context Aggregation with Reflection Prior for Glass Surface Detection.” . CVPR2021
(Thanks for them to help with the first paper which I have joined.)
