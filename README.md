## Jerry He(何泽邦)'s homepage

I am the Msc Student of City University of Hong Kong. My interests include image restoration, binary-class segmentation and so on.

Currently, I work on a small interesting project that transferring the detection models in natural scenes to the animation scenes(Such as the games).

In the recent time, the animation scene I have tried is the game scene *Xenoblade2* which is developed by *Nintendo*. Below is the bried introduction of the small project.
